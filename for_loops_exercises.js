// Exercise 1:
// Loop and If Statement
// Write a program that prints all the EVEN numbers from 1 to 20.
// Use a for loop and an if statement to check if a number is even.

// Exercise 2:
// Array Manipulation
// Given an array of numbers, find the sum of all positive numbers in the array.
// If the array is empty, print "Array is empty."

// Exercise 3:
// Object Manipulation
// Create an object representing a student with properties like name, age, and grade.
// Write a function that adds a new property to the student object, like for ex. "school" with a value of "High School."

/**
 * addSchool("school", "High School")
 * console.log(student) ==> { school: "HighSchool" }
 */

// Exercise 4:
// Loop and Array
// Write a program that takes an array of names and prints a welcome message for each name.
// Use a for-of loop for iteration.

// Exercise 5:
// Create two objects representing two books with properties like title,
// and author. Add 'yearPublished' property to each object.
// Write a function that compares the publication years of the two books
// and prints the older one.
const book1 = {
  title: "The Catcher in the Rye",
  author: "J.D. Salinger",
};

const book2 = {
  title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  author: "Harper Lee",
};

function compareBooks(book1, book2) {}

// Exercise 6:
// Write a function that takes an array of strings and modifies it
// by adding the word "Code" to the end of each string.
const languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "Java", "C#", "C++"];

// Exercise 7:
// Loop and If Statement
// Write a program that prints all the ODD numbers from 1 to 20.
// Use a for loop and an if statement to check if a number is odd.
